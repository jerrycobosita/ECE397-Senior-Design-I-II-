Abstract
	In today’s world, one hears countless cases related to drug overdose, it is something that affects young and old. Drug addiction, which could be compared to a disease,
  is treatable but with the help of others. Therefore, there was a need to make efforts to protect our people and help battle rising cases of overdose. JAMA LLC is 
  progressing towards developing JAMA Pill, a pill dispensing device, that will dispense pills at specified times to prevent patients from overdose. It will have a 
  separate compartment for each dosage and a rotating motor to rotate the compartments at the specified times. It will also have a clock to set the alarms and keep track 
  of the dispensed pills. Our preliminary design was based on the results of our user survey and study. This aided us in developing our design options, as well as our 
  marketing and engineering requirements.

Project Goals
	We aim to make JAMA Pill the best available pill dispenser on the market for people who misuse opioids and to aid in their rehabilitation process. JAMA Pill’s design is 
  going to revolve around a device that dispenses opioid-medication pills only at the correct dosage and correct time. The device will have a locking mechanism that cannot 
  be tampered with, if tampered with it will output a safety action such as raising a flag to the pharmacist or caretaker(s). Lastly, JAMA Pill will have an emergency 
  button that dispenses an emergency dosage in the instance that the person with an opioid problem needs it. During this situation, the machine will lock itself and will 
  not dispense any further dosages and it will raise a flag to the pharmacist or caretaker(s), only then the pharmacist or caretaker(s) must manually unlock JAMA Pill. 
  Machines like the JAMA Pill are generally on the market for $80-$200. Some of these machines only dispense pills, some of these machines don’t have locking mechanisms, 
  but none of these machines have an emergency button.

Needs Statement
  The United States is facing an opioid crisis, characterized by drug overdose on prescription painkillers which requires emergency care. An estimated 10.6 million people,
  in the US, reported opioid misuse and about 2 million have opioid-use disorder. There is a need for a product that limits a patient’s access to opioids while still 
  delivering their medication in order to reduce the likelihood of abuse and promote recovery.

Objective Statement
  Our objective is to introduce a pill dispenser which will come equipped with a built in 7 segment display, which will work as a clock, and a buzzer to alarm the user to
  take their pill. It is a useful product as it is made with people’s convenience in mind. Current products don’t come in with a locking mechanism which could limit users
  from a potential overdose. Another issue with current products is that it is too costly for most people to buy. Therefore, the current design in mind will take measures
  to keep the price low as well as perform the desired functionality.
